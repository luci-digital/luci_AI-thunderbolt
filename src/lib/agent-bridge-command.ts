/**
 * Shell-command composers for the bridge connect flow.
 *
 * A catalogue agent is a local CLI (npx / uvx / binary). To reach it from the
 * app the user runs `zeus bridge`, which spawns the agent's CLI and exposes it
 * over a loopback WebSocket (`ws://127.0.0.1:PORT`). These helpers build the
 * three copyable commands the connect dialog walks the user through:
 *
 *   1. install the bridge (`composeInstallCommand`)
 *   2. run the bridge wrapping the agent (`composeBridgeCommand`)
 *   3. (the launch fragment alone, `composeLaunchCommand`, for display/tests)
 *
 * Binary-distributed agents have no portable one-line launch, so
 * `composeBridgeCommand` returns `null` for them and the UI points the user at
 * the agent's own site/repo instead.
